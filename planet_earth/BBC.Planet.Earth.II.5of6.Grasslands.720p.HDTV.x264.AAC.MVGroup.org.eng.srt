1
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,660
One quarter of all the land on Earth
is covered by a single,

2
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:40,540
remarkable type of plant.

3
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:51,220
Almost indestructible, it can
grow two feet in a day...

4
00:00:58,060 --> 00:01:01,780
..and be tall enough
to hide a giant.

5
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:04,060
LOW RUMBLING

6
00:01:05,780 --> 00:01:10,780
That plant is grass, and the
world it creates is truly unique.

7
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:28,620
The grass in northern India
is the tallest on the planet,

8
00:01:28,620 --> 00:01:32,580
home to some of the most impressive
creatures to tread the Earth.

9
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:38,980
GRUNTING

10
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,420
These are the good times,
but in just a few months,

11
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:54,140
all this fresh growth will be gone

12
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:57,100
and the animals
will be forced to move on.

13
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:04,420
That is the way things are on
grasslands across the planet.

14
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,180
BIRDS TWEET

15
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:12,660
A cycle of abundance,
destruction and rebirth

16
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:15,100
that affects every creature
that lives here.

17
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:25,580
LOW RUMBLING

18
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,980
The largest grassland on Earth,
the vast Eurasian Steppe,

19
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:43,020
stretches one third of the way
around our planet.

20
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:47,820
Spring rain has brought fresh grass
and, with it, new life.

21
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:54,700
A relic from the ice age,

22
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:57,060
a baby saiga antelope,

23
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:58,540
just three hours old.

24
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,500
His only company, his twin.

25
00:03:06,020 --> 00:03:10,300
Until they can stand, their mother
has left them hidden in the grass.

26
00:03:18,340 --> 00:03:21,340
They should be safe,
as long as they remain quiet.

27
00:03:23,780 --> 00:03:24,780
HE BLEATS

28
00:03:27,060 --> 00:03:29,780
For these calves, the clock
is already ticking.

29
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,020
Their herd will soon be moving on,
seeking the freshest, new grass.

30
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:38,380
BLEATING

31
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:40,780
HE BLEATS

32
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,900
HE BLEATS

33
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:56,460
Their lanky legs are a sure sign
that they're built for a life

34
00:03:56,460 --> 00:03:58,180
on the move.

35
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:06,620
HE BLEATS

36
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:11,300
BLEATING

37
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:24,340
Saiga always give birth to twins,

38
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:26,380
so their numbers grow rapidly

39
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:28,420
just when grass is plentiful.

40
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:35,780
Their bizarrely shaped nose can
detect fresh growth

41
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,780
from hundreds of miles away.

42
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:45,580
BLEATING

43
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:53,940
The young twins will now begin
the nomadic life they share with

44
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,780
most animals on the
world's open plains.

45
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:21,260
Grasslands occur where rain is too

46
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:23,980
sporadic for forests to exist.

47
00:05:23,980 --> 00:05:26,740
THUNDER RUMBLES

48
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:30,340
WIND WHOOSHES

49
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,540
The rain that a grassland needs
to survive for a year

50
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,460
might arrive all at once.

51
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:48,140
CRASHING AND RUMBLING

52
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,820
Storms like these can release

53
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,060
12 inches of rain in 24 hours.

54
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:18,540
Not much fun if you're out in it.

55
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,860
Eventually, the Earth
can't soak up any more...

56
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:36,140
RUMBLING

57
00:06:36,140 --> 00:06:39,740
..and the grassland
undergoes a radical change.

58
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,220
Many plants would drown here,
but grasses thrive.

59
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:55,740
They grow so fast,

60
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,420
their leaves quickly rise above
the water and into the sunlight.

61
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:03,540
BIRDS TWEET

62
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:05,580
Here in southern Africa,

63
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:12,260
water transforms one of the most
remarkable grasslands on Earth.

64
00:07:12,260 --> 00:07:13,540
The Okavango.

65
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:21,540
Every year, 5,000 square miles
of grassland are flooded.

66
00:07:29,740 --> 00:07:33,620
For one pride of lions,
this poses a major problem.

67
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,780
There may be plenty of prey around,
but lions struggle

68
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,020
to run it down in water.

69
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,660
CUBS MEOW

70
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:59,740
If their mothers
don't make a kill soon,

71
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:01,780
the cubs might not survive the week.

72
00:08:11,740 --> 00:08:13,420
But fuelled by the flood,

73
00:08:13,420 --> 00:08:17,420
the eruption of grass
attracts new possible prey.

74
00:08:20,460 --> 00:08:23,060
Buffalo arrive in herds
2,000 strong.

75
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:34,580
Powerful, aggressive and united,

76
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:37,340
they're the most dangerous animal
a lion can face.

77
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:03,220
HE GRUNTS

78
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:16,420
The biggest bulls don't run.

79
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,380
They're simply too huge
to be scared of lions.

80
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:29,740
At 900 kilos, he weighs more
than all five lionesses combined.

81
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,540
The pride do have
numbers on their side...

82
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,620
..but one sweep of his horns
could be deadly.

83
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:56,460
One distracts the bull up front,

84
00:09:56,460 --> 00:09:58,620
while her sisters attack
from behind.

85
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:13,860
The cats must somehow topple the
buffalo, but with swamp underfoot,

86
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:15,500
they can't get any traction.

87
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,700
LIONS ROAR

88
00:10:58,580 --> 00:10:59,980
The bull is weakening...

89
00:11:01,180 --> 00:11:03,220
..but the lions are tiring too.

90
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:11,700
It's now a battle of will
as much as strength.

91
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:18,580
To live, the bull must somehow
shake off the lioness.

92
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,260
The bull is wounded, but thanks
to his two-inch-thick hide,

93
00:12:00,260 --> 00:12:01,420
he will recover.

94
00:12:07,740 --> 00:12:11,260
For the pride,
these are hungry times.

95
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:13,220
CUB SQUEAKS

96
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:22,780
But ultimately,
once the water recedes,

97
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:26,860
there will be new life and new food
to benefit all.

98
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:37,620
In the right conditions,

99
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:40,780
grasses have the extraordinary
ability to grow from

100
00:12:40,780 --> 00:12:44,260
first shoots to flower
in a matter of only days.

101
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:55,700
Grasses become the miniature
equivalents of fruiting trees.

102
00:13:03,140 --> 00:13:05,700
And, for creatures living
within the grass,

103
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,820
this is a landscape as vast and
towering as any rainforest.

104
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:18,060
An excellent place to
build a tiny treehouse...

105
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,860
..for a harvest mouse.

106
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,660
During summer, European meadowlands
are full of food...

107
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,940
..but only for those
that can reach it.

108
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:05,020
Climbing grass is harder
than climbing trees,

109
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:07,980
not least because their stems
just won't stay still.

110
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:19,140
A prehensile tail acts
like a fifth limb,

111
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:19,340
A prehensile tail acts
like a fifth limb,

112
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:23,300
so she's as agile as a monkey
clambering around in a tree.

113
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:27,380
STEM 'CREAKS'

114
00:14:31,540 --> 00:14:35,100
And just as well, for the best food
in this tiny forest

115
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:37,220
is at the very top of its canopy.

116
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:50,700
Feeding up here, she's exposed.

117
00:14:57,860 --> 00:14:59,100
A barn owl.

118
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,820
Not her finest move...

119
00:15:35,620 --> 00:15:36,940
..but it did the trick.

120
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:42,700
Harvest mice seldom go all the way
down to the ground.

121
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:49,260
It's a tangled and dangerous world
down here.

122
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:07,740
But she can read the pattern of
the stems overhead like a map,

123
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:09,620
and so find her way home.

124
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,980
And not a minute too soon.

125
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:26,860
There are mouths to feed.

126
00:16:40,020 --> 00:16:42,460
Her babies must fatten up quickly.

127
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,420
They need to harvest the
summer grasses

128
00:16:47,420 --> 00:16:49,460
while they're still rich with food.

129
00:16:57,660 --> 00:17:01,140
On the African savanna, too,
seasonal grasses

130
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,980
are filled with life,

131
00:17:02,980 --> 00:17:04,980
but it won't last long.

132
00:17:08,340 --> 00:17:11,300
Carmine bee-eaters are
superb aerial hunters...

133
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,180
..experts at catching insects
in mid-air.

134
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:27,060
But they have no way of flushing
their prey out of the grass.

135
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,380
INSECTS HUM AND CLICK

136
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,700
Once alarmed, most insects stay put.

137
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:47,380
The bee-eaters need someone
to stir things up a bit.

138
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:54,620
A kori bustard.

139
00:17:59,580 --> 00:18:02,100
It's the world's
heaviest flying bird,

140
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,940
so it should be bulky enough
to kick up some insects.

141
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,660
BUZZING

142
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,820
Bingo!

143
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,700
Until someone else comes along...

144
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,660
..and cramps your style.

145
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,420
Never mind.

146
00:18:29,420 --> 00:18:32,060
Perhaps there are
bigger opportunities ahead.

147
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:36,340
What about an ostrich?

148
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,780
The heaviest bird of all.

149
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,820
This time, there's more
than enough transport to go around.

150
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:03,700
Soon, almost every ostrich has
its own passenger.

151
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:15,340
But free riders are
only tolerated for so long.

152
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:25,620
What the bee-eaters really need
is a creature so big,

153
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,220
it won't even notice them.

154
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:30,740
SNORTING

155
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:34,420
LOW RUMBLING

156
00:19:37,580 --> 00:19:42,620
Nothing cuts a swathe through grass
like an African bull elephant.

157
00:19:53,140 --> 00:19:55,380
ELEPHANT GROWLS

158
00:19:59,060 --> 00:20:03,740
The trick is to fly as close to the
front of the giant as possible.

159
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:06,420
They only have a split second
to grab the prize.

160
00:20:16,660 --> 00:20:20,940
As more insects are stirred up,
the competition intensifies.

161
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:24,740
BIRDS CHIRP

162
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:46,580
With summer drawing to a close,
the race to stock up is on.

163
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:57,100
Soon the grass will wither, and
this opportunity will have gone.

164
00:21:07,140 --> 00:21:09,420
As the dry season takes hold,

165
00:21:09,420 --> 00:21:12,500
food becomes increasingly thin
on the ground.

166
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:17,740
Now, only the most specialised
predators on the plains

167
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,180
can make a living.

168
00:21:25,220 --> 00:21:29,780
She may be spotted like a cheetah,
but this cat is no sprinter.

169
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:48,060
Instead, she has extra long legs,
which give her a high vantage point.

170
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:01,620
But a serval cat's main weapon

171
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:04,180
are enormous radar ears.

172
00:22:04,180 --> 00:22:06,660
RUSTLING

173
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:11,300
They help her pinpoint prey
hiding in the grass.

174
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:22,940
But the prey she seeks are canny.

175
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,380
Southern vlei rats.

176
00:22:31,620 --> 00:22:34,740
They know that any sustained
movement can give them away.

177
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:43,020
So they move in short bursts.

178
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:54,980
But even the slightest rustle
will give her a clue.

179
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,860
Warm.

180
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:31,420
Warmer.

181
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:46,980
Missed.

182
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:50,460
RUSTLING

183
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:22,220
RUSTLING

184
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,420
RUSTLING

185
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:38,620
BIRD TWEETS

186
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,260
SQUEAKING

187
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:08,980
In better times,
she could catch ten a day.

188
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:14,740
But now, with so few rodents around,
she will have to go hungry.

189
00:25:17,300 --> 00:25:19,620
As drought intensifies,

190
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:22,060
life gets tougher for all.

191
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:33,060
Predators with permanent territories
must tough it out,

192
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:36,900
while most of their prey disappear
over the horizon.

193
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,820
GRUNTING AND MOOING

194
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,780
To avoid starvation, many grassland
animals follow

195
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:46,300
a nomadic way of life.

196
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,500
Over two million wildebeest wander
the East African savannas,

197
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,300
chasing the rains.

198
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:10,060
And they are not alone.

199
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:17,780
Arriving on the wing, Jackson's
widowbirds also seek fresh grass.

200
00:26:20,260 --> 00:26:23,380
Although, it's not just food
that they're after.

201
00:26:27,740 --> 00:26:30,020
This male wants a mate.

202
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:36,540
He's grown elaborate
breeding plumage for this moment.

203
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:41,140
But he needs a stage
on which to show it off.

204
00:26:45,620 --> 00:26:50,660
By carefully selecting grass blades,
each trimmed to the correct length,

205
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,820
he's creating something
very special.

206
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:09,980
He needs an even surface...

207
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,380
..and a centrepiece.

208
00:27:16,380 --> 00:27:17,820
The stage is set.

209
00:27:25,340 --> 00:27:27,860
The problem is, can she see it?

210
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:30,420
BIRDS TWEET

211
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,620
He has competition.

212
00:27:33,620 --> 00:27:34,580
TWEETING

213
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:40,180
TWEETING

214
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:47,900
It might take more than a little
gardening to impress the ladies.

215
00:27:50,060 --> 00:27:51,900
Jumping is the right idea...

216
00:27:53,420 --> 00:27:56,020
..but he's misjudged
the height of the grass.

217
00:27:56,020 --> 00:28:00,020
TWEETING

218
00:28:05,660 --> 00:28:07,820
His rival makes it look easy.

219
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:09,500
TWEETING

220
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:15,740
TWEETING

221
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,260
TWEETING

222
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,540
TWEETING

223
00:28:30,780 --> 00:28:32,580
Time to raise his game.

224
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,660
TWEETING

225
00:29:08,540 --> 00:29:10,780
It's not only who jumps the highest,

226
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,820
but who can keep doing
so the longest.

227
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,620
Unable to go the distance, his
rivals drop out one by one.

228
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:34,660
Stamina has won him admirers.

229
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,300
Now he can show off
his courtship arena.

230
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:52,220
And engage in a little romantic
hide-and-seek.

231
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,980
Finally, he's done enough.

232
00:30:18,460 --> 00:30:22,620
The East African savannas
support millions of grazers.

233
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:27,820
Each year, they devour
millions of tonnes of grass.

234
00:30:29,980 --> 00:30:33,940
And yet, there's one creature here
whose impact is far greater

235
00:30:33,940 --> 00:30:40,860
than all these animals combined.

236
00:30:40,860 --> 00:30:44,660
They're found wherever
grass grows on the planet.

237
00:30:44,660 --> 00:30:48,300
Yet their labours go
almost entirely unnoticed.

238
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:55,420
One of the most remarkable
is found here,

239
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:58,660
on the grasslands of South America.

240
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:03,260
These blades are so tough

241
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:06,900
that virtually no large grass eaters
can stomach them.

242
00:31:08,020 --> 00:31:12,460
Yet, they are harvested
on an industrial scale...

243
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:18,820
..by tiny grass-cutter ants.

244
00:31:25,780 --> 00:31:28,580
But they themselves
can't digest one bit of it.

245
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:32,980
So, why bother?

246
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:39,620
The answer is underground.

247
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,820
And it's very ingenious.

248
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:54,220
Each blade is cut to length and
placed into a garden of fungus.

249
00:31:58,420 --> 00:32:01,220
The rotting grass feeds the fungus

250
00:32:01,220 --> 00:32:05,460
and, in turn,
the fungus feeds the ants.

251
00:32:08,020 --> 00:32:13,380
But feeding five million workers
requires intensive agriculture.

252
00:32:15,660 --> 00:32:19,100
Luckily, they are
an industrious lot.

253
00:32:23,380 --> 00:32:31,940
This colony alone will collect over
half a tonne of grass every year.

254
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:35,820
With billions of ant colonies
across the world's grasslands

255
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:38,500
all doing exactly the same thing,

256
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:41,380
that's a mind-boggling
amount of grass.

257
00:33:13,740 --> 00:33:16,820
will be harvested by an insect.

258
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,300
In northern Australia,

259
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:28,780
termites memorialise their industry
in sculpture.

260
00:33:35,500 --> 00:33:39,940
These astonishing mounds
are ten feet tall.

261
00:33:39,940 --> 00:33:43,140
They're always built
on a north-south axis

262
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:47,580
which is why their builders
are called compass termites.

263
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:04,500
These castles of clay protect
their builders from extremes of heat

264
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:08,540
and seasonal floods
experienced on many grasslands.

265
00:34:19,660 --> 00:34:24,860
Termites manage to do
what most grass eaters can't -

266
00:34:24,860 --> 00:34:29,140
break down dead grass
and extract the nutrients.

267
00:34:29,140 --> 00:34:34,180
But they themselves can be food
for those that can reach them.

268
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:41,340
A two-foot-long tongue...

269
00:34:42,700 --> 00:34:45,180
..covered in microscopic hooks...

270
00:34:48,700 --> 00:34:53,460
..followed by claws
longer than those of a velociraptor.

271
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:02,700
A giant anteater
on the plains of South America.

272
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:10,140
It can devour
20,000 insects a day.

273
00:35:15,220 --> 00:35:20,860
Powerful forelegs enable it to
rip apart a termite hill with ease.

274
00:35:30,660 --> 00:35:36,220
And, as the sun bakes the grass,
the termites face new danger.

275
00:35:57,860 --> 00:36:07,140
In minutes,
fire turns grassland to ash.

276
00:36:15,980 --> 00:36:18,620
But the grasses are not dead.

277
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:22,060
Their underground stems are
unharmed.

278
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:27,500
Weeks, months may pass

279
00:36:27,500 --> 00:36:30,140
but, eventually,
the rains will return

280
00:36:30,140 --> 00:36:32,580
and the grass will sprout again.

281
00:36:39,580 --> 00:36:54,940
Some grasslands must endure
not only fire, but ice.

282
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:05,660
BISON GROWLS

283
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:13,140
In summer, bison roamed freely,

284
00:37:13,140 --> 00:37:16,860
almost continuously cropping
the abundant green grass.

285
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,300
Now that grass is not only withered
and frozen, it's about to be buried.

286
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,740
GRUNTING

287
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:50,620
60 million tonnes of snow now
blanket this herd's territory.

288
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:57,180
Pushing through deep snow
is exhausting work

289
00:37:57,180 --> 00:38:00,700
and the bison
are now slowly starving.

290
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:11,500
Just keeping warm
saps huge amounts of energy.

291
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,340
GROWLING

292
00:38:16,380 --> 00:38:21,380
Their thick coats can insulate them
down to minus 20 Fahrenheit.

293
00:38:21,380 --> 00:38:24,100
It's now minus 40.

294
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,740
The only thing
that will keep them alive

295
00:38:29,740 --> 00:38:32,460
is buried beneath
three feet of snow.

296
00:38:37,140 --> 00:38:40,940
And that's a problem shared
with a surprising neighbour.

297
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:02,300
The food the fox seeks
is also deep beneath the snow.

298
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,180
GROWLING

299
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:16,300
The survival of both creatures

300
00:39:16,300 --> 00:39:19,700
depends on getting through
to the ground.

301
00:39:24,780 --> 00:39:28,340
For the bison, it will be
a matter of brute strength.

302
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:38,220
Massive neck muscles enable them
to shovel five tonnes of snow a day.

303
00:39:43,900 --> 00:39:47,380
Their lightweight neighbour
needs more precision.

304
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:08,740
BISON GROWLS

305
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:17,140
The bison have reached their goal.

306
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,940
A mouthful of withered grass.

307
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:29,100
And where the bison have dug,
the fox now spots an opportunity.

308
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,180
Every footstep counts.

309
00:40:41,820 --> 00:40:44,060
But he mustn't break through...

310
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,660
yet.

311
00:40:48,820 --> 00:40:52,580
He listens carefully
to pinpoint his target.

312
00:40:57,820 --> 00:40:59,220
It's moving.

313
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,060
A vole.

314
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,340
Small,
but 100 times more nutritious

315
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:30,420
than a mouthful of dried grass.

316
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:38,900
To get through the winter
on these prairies,

317
00:41:38,900 --> 00:41:42,860
sometimes brain beats brawn.

318
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:54,940
Ultimately, life on all grasslands
depends on the turn of the seasons.

319
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:24,100
500 miles further north
than any tree can survive,

320
00:42:24,100 --> 00:42:26,700
grass returns to life.

321
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:42,460
Caribou females have journeyed
to the far north to calve.

322
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:51,500
Over 70,000 caribou babies
will be born in the next few days.

323
00:42:55,060 --> 00:43:00,980
As the calves appear, so too do the
leaves of the newly-sprouting grass.

324
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:06,380
And the calves
must strengthen quickly.

325
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:09,580
Within days, they will have
to keep up with their parents

326
00:43:09,580 --> 00:43:12,140
on a never-ending march.

327
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:23,100
At one-day-old, they are already
faster than an Olympic sprinter.

328
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:26,740
They are testing the legs that
will carry them thousands of miles.

329
00:43:28,260 --> 00:43:31,140
Better to learn
their limitations now.

330
00:43:38,660 --> 00:43:40,500
CALF HONKS

331
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:54,860
It may look playful, but there's
no harder life on the grasslands

332
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:57,580
than that facing these infants.

333
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:03,260
The caribou mothers
now join together,

334
00:44:03,260 --> 00:44:06,740
each with an infant
exactly the same age.

335
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:20,220
They're setting off on the greatest
overland trek made by any animal.

336
00:44:43,100 --> 00:44:49,300
But wherever grass eaters travel,
predators lie in wait.

337
00:44:54,700 --> 00:44:57,180
Here they are.

338
00:44:57,180 --> 00:44:59,260
Arctic wolves.

339
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:07,580
They must seize their chance

340
00:45:07,580 --> 00:45:10,740
while the caribou
pass through their territory.

341
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:31,980
CARIBOU GRUNTS

342
00:45:46,140 --> 00:45:51,060
The wolf runs at the herd, trying
to flush out the weak or the slow.

343
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,620
A calf is separated.

344
00:46:10,500 --> 00:46:15,140
At full tilt, 40-miles-an-hour,
the wolf is just faster.

345
00:46:23,460 --> 00:46:25,940
But the calf has stamina.

346
00:46:55,380 --> 00:46:57,540
Only a few weeks old

347
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:01,620
and this calf's will to survive
is remarkable.

348
00:47:06,140 --> 00:47:08,540
And it needs to be,

349
00:47:08,540 --> 00:47:11,340
for these young caribou
have now started a journey

350
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:13,980
that will last a lifetime...

351
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,500
..forever chasing the seasonal
growth of the grass

352
00:47:20,500 --> 00:47:22,100
on which they depend.

353
00:47:30,860 --> 00:47:32,700
Like all grassland creatures,

354
00:47:32,700 --> 00:47:36,180
they are at the mercy
of these unpredictable,

355
00:47:36,180 --> 00:47:38,980
but ultimately bountiful lands.

356
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:49,020
Grass can survive some of
the harshest conditions on Earth -

357
00:47:49,020 --> 00:47:53,380
flood, fire, and frost -
and still flourish.

358
00:48:03,260 --> 00:48:07,060
So it is, the grasslands
provide a stage

359
00:48:07,060 --> 00:48:11,140
for the greatest gatherings
of wildlife on planet Earth.

360
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:29,340
For the grasslands team, no location
would prove as challenging

361
00:48:29,340 --> 00:48:33,820
as that dominated by elephant grass
in north-east India.

362
00:48:33,820 --> 00:48:36,380
The aim, to capture intimate images

363
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:39,180
of some of the world's
most elusive creatures

364
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:42,300
using the latest technology.

365
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:51,300
But they will need to be careful.

366
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:56,900
ELEPHANT TRUMPETS

367
00:48:56,900 --> 00:48:59,540
More people are killed
by wildlife here in Kaziranga...

368
00:48:59,540 --> 00:49:00,820
ELEPHANT ROARS

369
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:05,380
..than in any other national park
on the planet.

370
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:09,220
Every time we go into these tunnels,

371
00:49:09,220 --> 00:49:11,300
we have to take an armed guard

372
00:49:11,300 --> 00:49:14,820
because there are so many animals
in here that are dangerous.

373
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,700
Tigers are probably
the least of our worries.

374
00:49:16,700 --> 00:49:19,420
But rhinos and buffalo, elephants,

375
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:22,140
sloth bear - all of them
can injure you

376
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:24,260
and we've got to keep up
with our armed guard!

377
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:32,460
The team have bumped
into their first obstacle.

378
00:49:33,620 --> 00:49:34,940
There's a rhino right there.

379
00:49:38,460 --> 00:49:40,940
Let's go back, because it's too
risky

380
00:49:40,940 --> 00:49:43,140
going through this heavy grass.

381
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:46,420
Let's get in the open.

382
00:49:47,900 --> 00:49:49,260
Another rhino.

383
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,460
Now we have two rhinos.
Let's get in here.

384
00:49:54,940 --> 00:49:55,940
GUARD SHOUTS

385
00:49:55,940 --> 00:49:57,980
OK.

386
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:00,740
The guard throws a ball of mud
to one side of the rhinos,

387
00:50:00,740 --> 00:50:06,780
moving the animals on without
harming them.

388
00:50:11,700 --> 00:50:14,100
OK, it's gone. OK.

389
00:50:14,100 --> 00:50:15,860
What about the other one?

390
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:17,100
Let's go, quick.

391
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:23,900
With the rhinos
now a safe distance away,

392
00:50:23,900 --> 00:50:25,700
the crew focus on the best spots

393
00:50:25,700 --> 00:50:28,060
to position their camera traps.

394
00:50:28,060 --> 00:50:30,460
I love that tunnel. The effect.

395
00:50:34,380 --> 00:50:37,460
Over 100 scaffold poles
provide the anchor points

396
00:50:37,460 --> 00:50:40,220
for these secret cameras.

397
00:50:40,220 --> 00:50:43,620
When an animal triggers
an infrared beam,

398
00:50:43,620 --> 00:50:46,620
the cameras will switch on
automatically and start recording.

399
00:50:46,620 --> 00:50:48,860
If it works,

400
00:50:48,860 --> 00:50:52,140
the remote-control cameras
should capture close-up footage

401
00:50:52,140 --> 00:50:56,140
without disturbing the animals
or putting the crew at risk.

402
00:50:56,140 --> 00:51:00,340
Basically, that's about as much
like grass as we can make it look.

403
00:51:02,180 --> 00:51:06,020
As night falls, the crew
head back to base for safety.

404
00:51:07,500 --> 00:51:11,580
It's time for the new technology
to prove its worth.

405
00:51:16,980 --> 00:51:21,940
At dawn, the crew have
a whodunnit mystery on their hands.

406
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:24,860
Oh, wow!

407
00:51:24,860 --> 00:51:26,180
That's carnage.

408
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:29,300
This looks like elephant, we think.

409
00:51:30,620 --> 00:51:33,660
This is scaffold pole, huh.

410
00:51:33,660 --> 00:51:35,820
They have bent... Look at that!

411
00:51:38,740 --> 00:51:42,460
It's a sad day.
You win some, you lose some

412
00:51:42,460 --> 00:51:45,900
and, this time,
the animals have outsmarted us.

413
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:48,580
And, in fact, check this out!

414
00:51:48,580 --> 00:51:49,940
Woohoo!

415
00:51:49,940 --> 00:51:54,580
So, this is our little army of
guards, protecting our trigger box.

416
00:51:54,580 --> 00:51:56,820
Do they bite? These ones?

417
00:51:56,820 --> 00:51:59,540
Do they bite? Sting?

418
00:51:59,540 --> 00:52:02,060
Argh! Argh. Ow! Oh.

419
00:52:02,060 --> 00:52:04,540
These little... BLEEP!

420
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,740
While Chadden irons out the bugs,

421
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:14,100
Sandesh has met some grumpy locals.

422
00:52:17,540 --> 00:52:21,380
Wild Asian water buffalo
have extraordinary senses.

423
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:26,260
Mothers will charge
if they feel threatened.

424
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:32,460
The guard carries a gun
in case a warning shot is needed,

425
00:52:32,460 --> 00:52:34,340
and with good reason.

426
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:38,900
More people are killed by buffalo

427
00:52:38,900 --> 00:52:42,620
than by any other animal
in Kaziranga.

428
00:52:47,580 --> 00:52:49,540
GUARD SHOUTS A WARNING

429
00:52:49,540 --> 00:52:51,460
That will wake you up
in the morning!

430
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,700
Many of the park staff
have cautionary tales about buffalo.

431
00:52:55,700 --> 00:52:59,900
HE SPEAKS IN HIS LANGUAGE

432
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,020
The buffalo caught him here.

433
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:06,860
Through his throat, and the horn
came out through his mouth

434
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:12,380
and flung him, before running away.

435
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:17,100
If the wildlife
is unfriendly to humans...

436
00:53:18,140 --> 00:53:21,860
..it's proving downright hostile
to camera traps.

437
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:25,380
Completely ripped-out
the scaffold poles.

438
00:53:25,380 --> 00:53:29,460
They've torn the triggers.

439
00:53:29,460 --> 00:53:31,860
While Chadden is convinced
it's elephants,

440
00:53:31,860 --> 00:53:34,900
the rest of the crew
are not so sure.

441
00:53:34,900 --> 00:53:38,180
That's huge!
It's almost like a human footprint.

442
00:53:38,180 --> 00:53:41,220
You can see the front paw,
the rear paw.

443
00:53:41,220 --> 00:53:46,140
We are now two weeks in
and it's very frustrating.

444
00:53:46,140 --> 00:53:49,260
I've never actually been anywhere
where the animals

445
00:53:49,260 --> 00:53:52,420
go after your equipment
and destroy it, more than here.

446
00:53:52,420 --> 00:53:56,660
It's time for the team
to do some detective work.

447
00:53:58,100 --> 00:54:01,220
Here is our little security camera.

448
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:04,940
If any animals are coming through
and vandalising our main cameras,

449
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:09,340
we hope that they're being caught
on these little things.

450
00:54:09,340 --> 00:54:10,460
Good.

451
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,140
As the crew up their spying efforts,

452
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:16,780
the guards take them
to a promising lead.

453
00:54:16,780 --> 00:54:21,500
Nothing attracts tigers
like a rhino carcass.

454
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:22,780
It's very fresh.

455
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,940
It's like from the morning. And
it looks like there's a tiger cub.

456
00:54:26,940 --> 00:54:29,780
So there should be
a tigress with cubs

457
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,860
coming to feed on this rhino
carcass. That's pretty cool.

458
00:54:34,860 --> 00:54:38,860
Chadden decides to give
the camera traps one last chance.

459
00:54:38,860 --> 00:54:40,940
If there are tigers around,

460
00:54:40,940 --> 00:54:44,780
they might scare away
the mystery vandals.

461
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:47,060
Elsewhere in the park,

462
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:51,060
the security cameras are turning up
some unexpected results.

463
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,540
The night-time... Yeah.
Survived another... Ooh!

464
00:54:54,540 --> 00:54:57,460
It's a bear!

465
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,420
Well, that's a very rare sighting.

466
00:54:59,420 --> 00:55:03,500
I've never seen a bear in Kaziranga.
Haven't you? In all my years, never.

467
00:55:03,500 --> 00:55:07,220
Oh, his fingernails...
Look at those, look at his claws.

468
00:55:07,220 --> 00:55:08,460
Right on the lens.

469
00:55:08,460 --> 00:55:11,620
So, I thought
this was elephant damage.

470
00:55:11,620 --> 00:55:17,540
I never thought we'd see
a sloth bear doing that.

471
00:55:21,100 --> 00:55:23,700
A return to the rhino carcass

472
00:55:23,700 --> 00:55:25,460
and the plot thickens.

473
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:29,020
Our transmitter's gone.

474
00:55:29,020 --> 00:55:30,700
That's what tigers think of
camera traps.

475
00:55:30,700 --> 00:55:34,100
There's a bit over there, pieces.

476
00:55:34,100 --> 00:55:37,620
The security cameras
have caught a new culprit.

477
00:55:37,620 --> 00:55:40,420
Oh, my goodness!
There they are. Oh!

478
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,860
There's the tigress, see that?

479
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:45,420
It's a tigress. Oh, it snarled
at the camera trap. Look at that!

480
00:55:45,420 --> 00:55:47,260
Sure don't like camera traps.

481
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:48,300
OK.

482
00:55:49,940 --> 00:55:52,020
With the technology struggling,

483
00:55:52,020 --> 00:55:56,300
Sandesh decides to put himself
on the front line.

484
00:55:56,300 --> 00:55:58,540
And now we're ready.

485
00:55:58,540 --> 00:55:59,940
Time to get the tiger.

486
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:05,380
He'll have no protection
apart from a thin wall of grass

487
00:56:05,380 --> 00:56:09,060
and must hope he's as well hidden
as the local wildlife.

488
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:13,180
Over the next five days,

489
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:16,540
Sandesh plays the role
of human camera trap.

490
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:23,300
Eventually, the more
hands-on approach pays off.

491
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:52,540
Traditional filming methods
and a little bit of patience

492
00:56:52,540 --> 00:56:57,100
have helped reveal
the hidden creatures of Kaziranga.

493
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,860
But it's good to know
there are still wild places

494
00:57:05,860 --> 00:57:09,260
where animals like
to keep their secrets.

495
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:15,180
EQUIPMENT CREAKS AND THUDS

496
00:57:15,180 --> 00:57:16,660
I knew it was elephants!

497
00:57:19,780 --> 00:57:22,220
Next time,

498
00:57:22,220 --> 00:57:25,460
we venture to
the newest habitat on Earth -

499
00:57:25,460 --> 00:57:27,540
our cities -

500
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:31,220
to reveal the extraordinary ways

501
00:57:31,220 --> 00:57:35,020
that animals survive
in this man-made world.
